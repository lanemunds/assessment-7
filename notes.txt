for double insert it is pushing the new numbers in at the beginning of the array. this 
causes every index along the array to shift one down. the longer the array the slower
this is going to go. so insert scales significantly worse than append. append is just 
adding the number at the end of the array. this allows it to just perform one action.
it is still slower in longer arrays but it scales much better because it doesn't have 
to shift the whole array.
